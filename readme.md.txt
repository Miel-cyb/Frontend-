 JavaScript can be run outside the browser using tools such as Node.js, Electron, Deno, etc.

- 5 things JavaScript can do are:
  1. Manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page
  2. Handle user interaction and events
  3. Perform network requests and data processing asynchronously
  4. Create and modify server-side applications with Node.js
  5. Build desktop applications with Electron

- ECMAScript was first released in 1997.

- To log to the console in JavaScript, you can use the `console.log()` method.

- JavaScript is used in various tech fields including FrontEnd (web development), 
BackEnd (server-side development with Node.js), Mobile development (React Native), 
Desktop development (Electron), Game development (Phaser), Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js), etc.

- Statically typed programming languages require type declarations at compile-time, while 
dynamically typed languages determine types during runtime. Examples of statically typed languages 
are C++, Java, Kotlin, and Go, while examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, 
and of course, JavaScript.

- The `null` data type in JavaScript represents the intentional absence of any object value, while 
the `undefined` data type represents the absence of a value in a variable that has been declared but 
not initialized.
